# License Notice - Important

## ⚠️ License Inconsistency Issue

**This experimental branch has inherited a license inconsistency from the original repository that requires official resolution.**

### Current Inconsistent State:

1. **ROOT LICENSE file**: Contains GPL v3 (General Public License)
2. **README.md**: Claims LGPL-3.0 (Lesser General Public License)  
3. **Source code headers**: Reference LGPL in many files
4. **GitHub badge**: Shows LGPL v3

### Impact:

- **Legal uncertainty** about which license actually applies
- **Compliance confusion** for users and contributors
- **Potential legal risk** due to inconsistent licensing statements

### Recommendation for Official Resolution:

The **original Greta project maintainers** should:

1. **Decide on single license**: Choose either GPL v3 OR LGPL v3
2. **Update all references consistently**:
   - Root LICENSE file
   - README.md documentation  
   - All source code headers
   - GitHub repository settings
3. **Consider license implications**:
   - **GPL v3**: More restrictive, requires derivative works to be GPL
   - **LGPL v3**: More permissive, allows linking with proprietary software

### For This Experimental Branch:

- **No license changes made** - preserving original inconsistency
- **Issue documented** for awareness
- **Requires official decision** from original project maintainers

### Note:

This experimental modernization branch (`modernization_with_claude`) should **not make licensing decisions** for the official Greta project. License resolution must come from the original project maintainers.
