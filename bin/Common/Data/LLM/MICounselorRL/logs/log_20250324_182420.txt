Agent: Hello. I'm Dr. Anderson. How are you doing today?
User:  I'm good. Thank you.
Agent: That's great to hear. What brings you in today?
User:  Not that good.
Agent: I see. Tell me more about what's been going on.
User:  It's just that there are a lot of tailing work.
Agent: That can be stressful. How have you been coping?
User:  I just did what I should do.
Agent: That makes sense. And how has alcohol fit into that for you?
User:  Actually, I don't have too much.
Agent: I see. How often do you have a drink?
User:  Many, many, many times.
Agent: About how many drinks would you say you have in a week?
