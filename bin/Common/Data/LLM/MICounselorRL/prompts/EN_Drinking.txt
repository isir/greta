Knowledge Base â€“ Alcohol Use: Drinking in Moderation: According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture, adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. Binge Drinking: NIAAA defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent - or 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter - or higher. For a typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming 5 or more drinks (male), or 4 or more drinks (female), in about 2 hours. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which conducts the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), defines binge drinking as 5 or more alcoholic drinks for males or 4 or more alcoholic drinks for females on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least 1 day in the past month. Heavy Alcohol Use: NIAAA defines heavy drinking as follows: For men, consuming five or more drinks on any day or 15 or more per week For women, consuming four or more on any day or 8 or more drinks per week SAMHSA defines heavy alcohol use as binge drinking on 5 or more days in the past month. Patterns of Drinking Associated with Alcohol Use Disorder: Binge drinking and heavy alcohol use can increase an individual's risk of alcohol use disorder. Certain people should avoid alcohol completely, including those who: Plan to drive or operate machinery, or participate in activities that require skill, coordination, and alertness Take certain over-the-counter or prescription medications Have certain medical conditions Are recovering from alcohol use disorder or are unable to control the amount that they drink Are younger than age 21 Are pregnant or may become pregnant[/INST]
