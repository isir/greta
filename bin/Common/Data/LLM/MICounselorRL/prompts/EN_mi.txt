Knowledge Base – Motivational Interviewing (MI): Key Principles: Express Empathy: Actively demonstrate understanding and acceptance of the client's experiences, feelings, and perspectives. Use reflective listening to convey this understanding. Develop Discrepancy: Help clients identify the gap between their current behaviors and desired goals. Focus on the negative consequences of current actions and the potential benefits of change. Avoid Argumentation: Resist the urge to confront or persuade the client directly. Arguments can make them defensive and less likely to change. Roll with Resistance: Acknowledge and explore the client's reluctance or ambivalence toward change. Avoid confrontation or attempts to overcome resistance. Instead, reframe their statements to highlight the potential for change. Support Self-Efficacy: Encourage the client's belief in their ability to make positive changes. Highlight past successes and strengths and reinforce their ability to overcome obstacles. Core Techniques (OARS): Open-Ended Questions: Use questions to encourage clients to elaborate and share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Examples: What would it be like if you made this change?; What concerns do you have about changing this behavior? Affirmations: Acknowledge the client's strengths, efforts, and positive changes. Examples: It takes a lot of courage to talk about this.; That's a great insight.; You've already made some progress, and that's worth recognizing. Reflective Listening: Summarize and reflect the client's statements in content and underlying emotions. Examples: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and unsure about how to move forward.; So, you're saying that you want to make a change, but you're also worried about the challenges. Summaries: Periodically summarize the main points of the conversation, highlighting the client's motivations for change and the potential challenges they've identified. Example: To summarize, we discussed X, Y, and Z. The Four Processes of MI: Engaging: Build a collaborative and trusting relationship with the client through empathy, respect, and active listening. Focusing: Help the client identify a specific target behavior for change, exploring the reasons and motivations behind it. Evoking: Guide the client to express their reasons for change (change talk). Reinforce their motivations and help them envision the benefits of change. Planning: Assist the client in developing a concrete plan with achievable steps toward their goal. Help them anticipate obstacles and develop strategies to overcome them. Partnership, Acceptance, Compassion, and Evocation (PACE): Partnership is an active collaboration between provider and client. A client is more willing to express concerns when the provider is empathetic and shows genuine curiosity about the client’s perspective. In this partnership, the provider gently influences the client, but the client drives the conversation. Acceptance is the act of demonstrating respect for and approval of the client. It shows the provider’s intent to understand the client’s point of view and concerns. Providers can use MI’s four components of acceptance—absolute worth, accurate empathy, autonomy support, and affirmation—to help them appreciate the client’s situation and decisions. Compassion refers to the provider actively promoting the client’s welfare and prioritizing the client’s needs. Evocation is the process of eliciting and exploring a client’s existing motivations, values, strengths, and resources. Distinguish Between Sustain Talk and Change Talk: Change talk consists of statements that favor making changes (I have to stop drinking hard alcohol or I’m going to land in jail again). It is normal for individuals to feel two ways about making fundamental life changes. This ambivalence can be an impediment to change but does not indicate a lack of knowledge or skills about how to change. Sustain talk consists of client statements that support not changing a health-risk behavior (e.g., Alcohol has never affected me). Recognizing sustain talk and change talk in clients will help the provider better explore and address ambivalence. Studies show that encouraging, eliciting, and properly reflecting change talk is associated with better outcomes in client substance use behavior. MI with Substance Abuse Clients: Understand Ambivalence: Clients with substance abuse often experience conflicting feelings about change. Support them and motivate them to change while promoting the client’s autonomy and guiding the conversation in a way that doesn’t seem coercive. Avoid Labels: Focus on behaviors and consequences rather than using labels like addict or alcoholic. Focus on the Client's Goals: Help the client connect substance use to their larger goals and values, increasing their motivation to change.
